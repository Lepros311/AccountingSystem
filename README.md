# Accounting System 1.0

This project is part of Zero to Mastery's [C# course](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/csharp-net-bootcamp/). The primary focus for this project is on implementation using object-oriented programming (OOP). The end result is a console app that acts as an accounting tool. It allows the user to input account balances, make positive and negative adjustments, apply interest, and transfer funds between accounts. 

## Requirements

- [x] Greet the user with a welcome message.
- [x] The accounting system should have a checking account and a premium account.
- [x] Each account account has an ID (number) and a balance (decimal number).
- [x] The user should be able to set a starting balance when creating an account.
- [x] The user should be able to deposit money at any time after creating a checking account.
- [x] The user should be able to calculate interest based on the current balance of the account.
- [x] The user should be able to print the ID and the current balance of the accounts at any time.
- [x] The premium account gets 1% extra interest.
- [x] The user should be able to transfer money from one account to another at any time.

## Challenge Feature
- [x] Instead of a fixed program flow, ask the user for input to open and manage the bank accounts.
